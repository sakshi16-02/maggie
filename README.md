If you’ve grown up in India you’ve probably grown up eating Maggi for a snack! I am such a huge fan of these Instant Noodles that even today I get cravings. Which is weird I know because I’m 30 but somehow you are never too old for Maggi Noodles!

And if you’ve grown up eating Maggi you’ve obviously experimented with it. Everyone I know has their favorite way of eating Maggi and I knew I had to share my favorite Maggi recipes with you guys. I mean how can I authentically be a good food blogger if I don’t. Because indulging in Maggi once in a while just feels so good. It’s not the best thing in the world to eat – I admit but it’s like that second slice of chocolate cake that you know you can’t resist.

Spicy Masala Maggi is super easy to make and probably everyones favourite maggi recipe. It's just like the maggi they make on the street but better!
